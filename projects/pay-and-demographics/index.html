<p>Local Law 18 of 2019 (LL18) requires the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to collect data from agencies relevant to pay and employment of the City’s municipal workforce every year and to make this data available to the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA). MODA is then responsible for three requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>issue a report on the data, aggregated by pay band, with specific attributes, and publish related code on the MODA Open Source Analytics Library;</li>
  <li>make a raw version of the data available to the City Council for 90 days; and</li>
  <li>conduct an analysis of the data, in conjunction with DCAS, to identify potential disparities based on gender, race, or other protected classes in terms of pay, employment rates, and retention rates.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the first <strong>Pay and Demographics Report</strong> on City of New York agency workforce pay and employment information in compliance with requirement #1 above for 2020.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> This is the City’s first annual publication of the Pay and Demographics Report; the report is based on City employee data as of December 31, 2018.</p>

<p>The first disparity analysis (#3 above) is due 90 days after the publication of the second annual report of aggregated pay and employment data in 2021.</p>

<p><strong>I. Pay Annualization and Conversion</strong></p>

<p>Of more than 180,000 employee records, roughly 95% represented employees whose pay is calculated on an annual basis or hourly basis does not require salary standardization before assigning a pay band. For the remaining 5% of records (9,136 employees), the following adjustments were made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>7,961 records of full-time employees whose pay is calculated on a daily or hourly basis were annualized using a conversion rate of 261 days/year or 1,827 hours per year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1,175 records of part-time employees whose pay is calculated on a pro-rated annual basis were converted to hourly pay using the conversion rate of 1,968 hours/year.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>See <strong>Appendix C</strong> for additional details, including the list of annualization and conversion rates used.</p>

<p><img src="/Project-Library/assets/img/projects/employee.JPG" alt="Pay Annualization and Conversion Rate" /></p>

<p><strong>II. Pay Band Selection Methodology</strong></p>

<p>The Agency Report Table provides two separate pay band denominations: (1)  a <strong>per -year pay band of $5,000 for full-time employees</strong>, and (2) a <strong>per-hour pay band of $0.50 for part-time and seasonal employees</strong>.</p>

<p>The values for these pay bands were selected to preserve the granularity of reporting without increasing the number of employee record aggregations with less than 5 observations.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The following diagram demonstrates how MODA integrated raw data provided by DCAS to the Agency Report Table. To view more detailed code on salary standardization and pay band derivation, please view the MODA Open Source Analytics Library [link to add].</p>

<p>Please see the PDF attached below for the wide format Agency Report Table on pay and demographic information of over 180,000 City employees as of December 31, 2018.</p>

<p>The data in the Table is organized by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employee Status by Full-Time, Part-Time, and Seasonal</li>
  <li>Agency Name by alphabetical order</li>
  <li>EEO-4 Job Category by alphabetical order</li>
  <li>Pay Band by increasing compensation</li>
</ul>

<p>The data includes pay that is less than the current 2020 minimum wage as of 2018<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">1</a></sup> for 13 part-time employees. The 13 employees are in College Aides and Community Service Aides titles (EEO-4 Job Category: Para-professionals), because the contractual collective bargaining increase was signed in 2019 with a salary effective date of December 31, 2018.</p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Employee Self-Service (ESS)</strong> - Employee Self-Service (ESS) is the online tool within NYCAPS that provides NYC employees with easy access to human resources, payroll, tax, City job applications and benefits information.</p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>EEO-4 Job Category</strong> - EEO-4 Job Category is used by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to classify a group of employees with comparable job responsibilities at comparable levels within an organization. DCAS classifies each civil service title to one of the eight EEO-4 Job Categories as part of its legal mandate to submit EEO-4 reports every two years. For a detailed description of each job category, please see the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeoc-form-164-state-and-local-government-information-eeo-4-instruction-booklet">EEO-4 Instruction Booklet</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Full-time, part-time and seasonal employees</strong> - Full-time employees include those who work a standard work week in a full-time title with a regular annual work schedule. In general, full-time employees work between 35 and 40 hours per week, and 261 days per year. Part-time employees are those who work fewer than 35 hours per week or are in titles having no standard hours per week or days per year. Seasonal employees such as lifeguards and many parks maintenance workers may work in either a part-time or full-time capacity. MODA reports data for seasonal employees separately from part-time and full-time employees per the Local Law 18 requirement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Local Law 18 (LL18)</strong> - Local Law 18 of 2019 is a law that requires MODA to issue an annual public report on aggregated pay and employment data, grant access to City Council for a 90 day period each year, and conduct an annual disparity analysis of pay, employment rates, and retention rates beginning in 2021.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Part-time Prorated Annual Employees</strong> - Employees paid on a prorated annual basis do not work full schedules and therefore their salary reflects the number of days that the employee worked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pay band</strong> - A pay band represents the minimum and maximum compensation range to assist with the grouping of employees. MODA selected two separate pay band denominations: Per-year $5,000 for full-time employees, and per-hour $0.50 for part-time and seasonal employees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pay calculation frequency</strong> - Indicates if the employee is paid on an annual, daily or hourly basis.</p>
