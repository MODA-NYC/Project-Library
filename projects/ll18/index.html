<p>On January 24, 2019, Introduction 633 of 2018: Reporting of pay and employment equity data, passed into Local Law 18 of 2019 (LL18). Pursuant to this local law, each year, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) collects data from agencies relevant to pay and employment of the City’s municipal workforce and makes this data available to the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA). Upon receiving this data from DCAS, MODA is then responsible for three requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>issue a report on the data, aggregated by pay band, with specific attributes; 
 a.  publish related code on the MODA Open Source Analytics Library;</li>
  <li>make a raw version of the data available to the City Council for 90 days; and</li>
  <li>conduct an analysis of the data, in conjunction with DCAS, to identify potential disparities based on gender, race, or other protected classes in terms of pay, employment rates, and retention rates.</li>
</ol>

<p>MODA submits this <strong>Pay and Demographics Report</strong> on City of New York agency workforce pay and employment information in compliance with requirement #1 above for 2020. This is MODA’s first annual publication of the Pay and Demographics Report; the report is based on City employee data on December 31, 2018.</p>

<p>The first disparity analysis (#3 above) is due 90 days after the publication of the second annual report of aggregated pay and employment data in 2021.</p>

<p>LL18 requires MODA to publish a report on the data by May 31st each year. However, this year, demands upon MODA to perform urgent Covid-19 data analytics work severely impacted the office staffing and operations during spring and summer of 2020. As a result, MODA’s publication of the 2020 Report occurred in October 2020.</p>

<p>The Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) was established by executive order in 2013 and codified in the City Charter in 2018, and supports City agencies in applying strategic analytical thinking to data in order to deliver services more equitably and effectively, and to increase operational transparency. MODA’s mission is to use data analytics to help City agencies deliver services more efficiently, facilitate citywide data operations, and implement the City’s Open Data Law. MODA is committed to government transparency and sharing agency data of interest to New Yorkers publicly, as permitted by law, through the Open Data program. More information about MODA can be found at www.nyc.gov/analytics.</p>

The Table covers over 180,000 employees from 36 City agencies and offices. The Table is a point-in-time snapshot of employees who were either active or on temporary leave (parental leave, military leave, illness, etc.) as of December 31st, 2018. The full list of agencies included in the mandate of LL18 is in Appendix B.</p>

<p>Each row in the Table represents a group of employees in a given agency with the same demographic, pay, and job category classification. To protect the privacy of employees, the sign “&lt;5” is used instead of the actual number for groups of less than five (5) employees, in accordance with the Citywide Privacy Protection Policies and Protocols.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>There are two steps involved in the establishment of <strong>pay bands</strong>, the only attribute derived by MODA in the Table:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, employees in the same employee status but whose pay is calculated based on different frequencies<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">1</a></sup>,  such as daily, hourly, annual or prorated, need to have their pay annualized or converted for pay comparison within the same employee status and;</li>
  <li>Second, once the pay is standardized, a common pay band is assigned across the full-time, part-time and seasonal employees in order to aggregate employees.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pay Annualization and Conversion</strong></p>

<p>To support the establishment of pay bands, MODA standardized the pay of 9,136 employees (approximately 5%) out of more than 180,000 employees, due to the differences in the pay calculation frequency of the full-time (annual, daily, and hourly) and part-time (hourly and prorated annual) employees, by:</p>

  <li>Converting the salaries of 1,175 part-time employees to an hourly pay who are paid on prorated annual<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">2</a></sup> basis using the conversion rate of 1,958 hours/year for the majority of these employees.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a full-time employee in the civil service title of Carpenter (EEO-4 Job Category: Skilled Craft) whose pay as of December 31, 2018 was $349.16 per day, had their pay annualized using the rate of 261 days per year<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, which amounts to a salary of $91,130.76 per year. Similarly, a part-time employee in the civil service title of School Lunch Aide (EEO-4 Job Category: Service and Maintenance) who was paid $29,539.00 on a prorated annual basis, had their prorated salary converted into its hourly equivalent using the calculation rate of 1,958 hours per year, which amounts to a pay of $15.09 per hour.</p>

<p>Out of the 9,136 employees whose pay was standardized through the method above, MODA identified 79 part-time employees paid on a prorated annual basis where information about the number of hours they worked was unavailable in NYCAPS. As a result, MODA used the standard number of hours worked per year in these titles to convert the prorated salaries of these employees into their hourly rates.</p>

<p>MODA’s approach to standardize pay, with the full list of annualization and conversion rates in Appendix D, is consistent with City methodology; however no standard Citywide methodology exists to standardize pay for comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Band Selection Methodology</strong></p>

<p>Once the pay is standardized into annual salaries or hourly rates, a challenge exists to select a common pay band across full-time, part-time, and seasonal employees whose pay is difficult to compare due to difference in hours worked.</p>

<p>For example, the pay of a part-time employee who earns $16.47 per hour as a Precinct Receptionist (EEO-4 Job Category: Administrative Support) would not be directly comparable to a full-time employee who earns $30,090.67 per year simply by assuming the part-time employee could work 1,827 hours a year<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. Part-time employees are those that work fewer than 35 hours per week or are in civil service titles having no standard hours per week or days per year.</p>

<p>As LL18 requires the selection of a pay band  for use, and to account for this potential misinterpretation of derived pay rates, the Agency Report Table maintains the usage of two separate pay band denominations: (1) <strong>per year pay band for full-time employees</strong>, and a separate (2) <strong>per hour pay band for part-time and seasonal employees</strong>. Based on MODA’s analysis across different pay bands to maximize the details on pay while ensuring anonymity, a <strong>$5,000 per year pay band is assigned to full-time employees</strong> and a separate <strong>$0.50 per hour pay band to part-time and seasonal employees.</strong></p>

<p>MODA selected a pay band of $5,000 for full-time employees because there are five percentage points fewer rows with a “&lt;5” sign than a pay band of $2,500, increasing the precision in the number of employees, particularly for several small and mid-sized agencies. Similarly, a $0.50 pay band for part-time and seasonal employees includes slightly fewer number of rows with the “&lt;5” sign than a pay band of $0.25.</p>

<p><em>NYCAPS:</em> The primary data source for the Agency Report Table is the New York City Automated Personnel System (NYCAPS), a centralized automated personnel system for human resources professionals, managers and employees to access and manage personnel and benefits information. Employee Self-Service (ESS) is the online tool within NYCAPS that provides NYC employees with access to human resources, payroll, tax, City job applications and benefits information. Through ESS, employees may access and can voluntarily choose to update their personal information, including their gender, ethnicity, and race.</p>

<p><em>Datasets:</em> The data provided by DCAS to MODA used in the creation of this Report provide a point-in-time snapshot for each full-time, part-time and seasonal employee active or on leave as of December 31, 2018. In addition to these datasets, MODA also received pay and employment information on seasonal employees active as of Summer 2018 to support representation of the range of seasonal employees employed by the City.</p>

<p><em>Minimum Wage:</em> The data includes pay that is less than the current 2020 minimum wage as of 2018<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">1</a></sup> for 13 part-time employees.

<p>APPENDIX C: AGENCY AND CITYWIDE SUMMARY OF THE AGENCY REPORT TABLE</p>

<p>This table below provides the total number of employees and a summary of the demographics for each agency represented in the LL18 Agency Report Table as of December 31, 2018.</p>

<p>Note: Demographics are only provided in percentages to protect the data privacy of smaller demographic groups. “N/A” represents %  that is rounded to 0%  but contains non-zero absolute values. It is not recommended, due to the rounding of percentages, to derive the absolute values of demographic groups as that could lead to inaccurate counts. % of demographic totals is calculated by dividing the total number of employees in a particular demographic group against the total number of employees in the City covered under LL18.</p>
