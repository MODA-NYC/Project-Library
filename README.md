# MODA Project Library

As required by Local Law 11 of 2012, each City entity must identify and ultimately publish all of its digital public data for publication by 2018. Every year on July 15, the NYC Open Data Plan provides an update of the City's progress by listing pertinent City-managed public datasets yet to be published along with their anticipated publication dates. Since 2015, the Compliance Plan has been accompanied by a report on the de Blasio administration's [*Open Data for All*](http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/487-15/de-blasio-administration-releases-open-data-all-city-s-new-open-data-plan) vision. *Open Data for All* is a strategic overhaul around how the City collects and reports data to New Yorkers, with a focus on helping as many New Yorkers as possible view, understand, and engage with information that describes how government works.

This repository serves as the digital version of that report, and is a counterpart to the [PDF version](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/OD4A-report_2017-1.pdf).

## Structure

The site is based on the open-source [DCP PLanning Labs](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-planninglabs.nyc) site, which in turn was inspired by [18f.gsa.gov](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov). The built site runs on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
