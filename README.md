# MODA Project Library

The Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics partners with New York City agencies to deliver measurable value to City services. The individual steps taken in these partnerships – including what type of analysis was selected and why, insights gained from subject matter experts, and disclaimers on source data – are as important as the results. “Open sourcing” analytics efforts not only increases visibility into the way City agencies use data and develop algorithms, it also helps spread awareness of the power of Open Data and data science in municipal service delivery.

This repository serves as the MODA Project Library, a microsite that includes descriptions of past analytics projects, including the source code, a plain-language description of the process, and implementation details. The site also contains documentation MODA’s *Open Source Analytics* values and a step-by-step implementation framework. 

## Structure

The site is based on the open-source [DCP PLanning Labs](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-planninglabs.nyc) site, which in turn was inspired by [18f.gsa.gov](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov). The built site runs on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
